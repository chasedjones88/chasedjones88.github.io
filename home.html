    <h4>Hi, my name is Chase, and I'm a computer scientist.</h4>
    <p>I'm 24 years old and currently attending Arizona State University for a Master's of Computer Science degree. I achieved my Bachelor's degree in 2019 <em>cum laude</em> at CSU Sacramento. I love everything to do with computers, from fixing them for family members, to learning how they work at both highest and simplest levels. My favorite subject has to be computer organization and architecture, but I'm also extremely interested in GPU computing and computing theory. In fact, I like computer organization so much I accepted a position at CSUS as a grader and tutor for the intro and graduate computer organization classes, and enrolled in the advanced class.</p>
    
    <p>Some of my favorite projects to-date were making the board game Battleship on an Arduino, programming a chess game in ARM Assembly on a Raspberry Pi Zero, and modeling a 16 bit MIPS-like CPU in Verilog HDL. I'm also currently working on making a spiritual successor to <em>Diablo</em>, developed by Blizzard North, in the Unity3D Engine making all my own assets and scripts.</p>
    
    <p>I enjoy spending time with my family, playing games, and working on hobby projects.</p>
